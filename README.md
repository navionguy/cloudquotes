Quote archive as an exercise in learning Buffalo.

The Quote archive begain as a way to entertain myself during boring meetings.  If you listen carefully,
people often say things that, if you have a twisted way of thinking about them, are quite funny.  Some
of the quotes just had to be shared with co-workers.  So, I started posting them on wall outside my
office.  That was 1997.

Now, some 22 years later, the quote wall has captured over 2300 quotes and is still going.  About six
years ago, I created a Windows program in C# that allowed me to enter the quotes into a MSSQL database.
This lead to a small linux service written in Go that would randomly display quotes from the database
in your browser.  My friends could now check out the latest quotes from their desk.  As long as they
were in the building.

Last year I discovered https://github.com/gobuffalo *The Go Web Eco-System* and started
playing with it in my spare time.

This repository is actually the second iteration of the archive using Buffalo, but the first built
with the hope of placing it on a server visible on the internet proper.  It isn't ready yet, but I'm
working on it.
